   <pre style="color:aqua" title="poem">Iâ€™ve forgotten,
    mostly I am trying to remember one-hit wonders, hymns,
             and musicals like West Side Story.
    Singing over and over what I can recall,
             I hum remnants on

         <p title="poen2">Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness,<br>
            Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun;<br>
         Conspiring with him how to load and bless<br>
            With fruit the vines that round the thatch-eves run;<br>
         To bend with apples the moss'd cottage-trees,<br>
            And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;</p> <hr>
